# Magnetic Mount for the Ring Video Doorbell

I have a steel door with glass on either side and no wires run for a doorbell.  The [Ring Video Doorbell](https://amzn.to/3vzFPwm) seemed a good fit, but my general issues with technology commitment (sorry Amazon, it's you not me) kept me from wanting to run screws through my door to get this thing installed.

This mount utilizes [4x 32mm disc magnets](https://amzn.to/2SxWQZj) to create a strong mount onto a ferrous surface such as a steel exterior door.  The mount is low profile and allows access to the battery door.

  * [Ring Video Doorbell 3](https://amzn.to/34pKzJc)
  * [Ring Video Doorbell 4](https://amzn.to/3hYKvIk)
* 4x [32mm x 5mm disc magnets](https://amzn.to/2SxWQZj)
* 4x [M3 x 5mm x 5.3mm threaded inserts](https://amzn.to/34tk99j)
* 4x [M3 x 6mm countersunk machine screws](https://amzn.to/3wV3Her)
* [CA "Super" Glue](https://amzn.to/3vzNaw7)
* [CA Glue Accelerant](https://amzn.to/2R8pboQ) (optional, makes for faster assembly and handy to have around)

## Printing Notes

I printed this in [PETG](https://amzn.to/3uwbL3z) as a tough and weather-proof material option.  Use 0.20mm layers and maybe dial up the perimeters for some extra strength.

## Assembly

1. Print the mount per the instructions above.
2. Test fit the magnets to ensure everything is working as expected.  These magents are STRONG, be extremely careful when working with them.
3. Apply CA glue to the printed cavity for one magnet
4. (Optional) apply CA accelerant to the back of one magnet
5. Place a single magnet into the cavity and let the glue bond (almost instant when using accelerant)
6. Repeat 3-5, now being very careful to keep a tight grip on both the mount and magnet as you bring additional magnets onto the mount.  They want to jump out of your hands and onto each other, smashing anything that gets in the way (like your fingers).  It's important to ensure that each magnet is fully bonded before proceeding to the next, or you can pull the magnet out of the cavity when the next magnet is brought close.
